## Suankularb Wittayalai School

โรงเรียนสวนกุหลาบวิทยาลัย is a public secondary school in Thailand, located at the north of Bangkok, in Rangsit, Pathum Thani. I taught around 120 students for a year, both Algebra, basic geometry, and beginner level calculus.

### Programming

While working there I wrote [some software](https://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/TexExamRandomizer) to generate personalized and individualized homework and exams, and automatic grading software for the students, to help them with their homework by encouraging them to work together to solve problems — rather than copying form the smartest kids in class — and to give them instant feedback on their progress.
